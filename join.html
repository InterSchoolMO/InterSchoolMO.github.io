                    Your message should include the name and contact details of the person who will represent you 
                    at Jury meetings. We prefer past NZMO Campers as Jury members, although a math teacher or a 
                    student with a strong interest in math is welcomed, too.

                    In addition, ISMO relies on its team of markers and donations from schools to function. Although 
                    this is not necessary, we would be truly grateful if you can nominate a few markers from your 
                    school, and/or give an estimate on how much funding you will be able to provide. Nominations 
                    and estimates are non-binding.

                    Please note that proposing a problem would make you ineligible for that year's competition, even if it isn't used.

It consists of one representative from each participating school, who can be either a student or a teacher. No qualifications, other than approval from your school, are required, although experience with math olympiad is recommended.</p>
